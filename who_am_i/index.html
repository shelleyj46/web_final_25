        <ol class="other_text">
            <li>sleep</li>
            <li>reading</li>
            <li>staring at the wall, lost in my own thoughts</li>
            <li>doing nothing</li>

    <h2>School:</h2>
    <p class="other_text">Obviously, I go to Eastside Prep. It teaches grades 5-12, I joined in 5th grade. I made this website for a school project(more on that later). My school is quite fun, but I wish we had a bigger campus. The spaces we do have are very nice though.<br> I kinda of wish I were back in 5th grade right now, we didn't have finals back then (or much homework).</p>
    <h2>Future Planning:</h2>
    <p class="other_text">Have you ever thought of what you want to be when you grow up? I certainly have. Maybe I'll be a scientist, or an astronaut, or a musician. Or, maybe I'll be a jam jar manufacturer, that sounds fun. Or, maybe I'll be just another CS major, that's fine too. Anyways, see why I like staring at the wall now? I honestly feel bad for my friends, they have to listen to me talk about these tangents. But then again, they do this too.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 35px; color: rgb(122, 216, 75); text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgb(156, 227, 120);">Fun Stuff!</h2>
    <p class="other_text"> Anyways, let's change the topic. Hearing all about me must be pretty boring. What is 243*(25-7)?</p>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('math').innerHTML = 243*(25-7)">Answer!</button>
    <p id="math"></p>
    <p class="other_text"> Okay, you probably don't like math. Math can be kind of fun sometimes, but I don't like multiplying by large numbers either. It's quite easy to make mistakes. That's why I use a calculator! (This is where other websites would advertise their calculators, but I won't.)</p>
